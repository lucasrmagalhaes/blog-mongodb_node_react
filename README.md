**Why MongoDB?**

Nonrelational database:
- Can push data to database without worrying about format (in other words, accepts any JSON object)
- Structure of data does not have to be defined in advance
- SQL not required
- Allows for creation of modulas, reusable components that can be arranged into a fully-functioning site
